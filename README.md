# mp3-player

This mp3-player was made from a model from 'https://lenguajejs.com/retos/nivel-medio/mp3-player/' as a challenge placed by ManzDev on his website.

It was made following the instructions, made with vanilla javascript, no libraries using only the native javascript audio api.

this mp3-player was made as the model given and fun to do.

The only diferent thing is that I chose my favorite songs with its album covers.

Animations were used for the graphical audio bar and for the list menu once you click on the right top icon.
